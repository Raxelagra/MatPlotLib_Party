# MatPlotLib_Party
A group of tech curious up-and-coming data analysts and data scientists hang out to explore visualizations using python.

A sample collection of data sets are provided for participants to explore and share their outputs.

CHALLENGE NO. ONE ACCEPTED!
With the challenge, when you download the notebook you'll see the visualisations but when you run the cell before all visualisations, they'll disappear so I advise you probably take a picture of them before you run those cells  or insert new lines to run your codes.

OR, when you download the notebook, create a copy and use that copy to do your assignment. So you'll use the original copy as reference.

The visualisations are there to give you a visual of how to go about your codes but your visualisations don't have to be exactly as you see in the notebook. 


Let's chill...
Cheers!
